The head of the national body for police commissioners resigned in order to appear on the bbc's question time following the manchester attack. Former association of police and crime commissioners (apcc) chief executive nazir afzal was advised against doing so by the organisation's board. This was because of potentially controversial policing issues that could have been raised on the show. But mr afzal stepped down and appeared on the programme on 25 may. The apcc said: "nazir told the board that he intended to go on question time to discuss the recent events in manchester. "the board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah.
