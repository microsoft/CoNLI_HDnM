A public school teacher who groped an 18-year-old girl has been given a nine-month suspended sentence. Chay roberts-jones was working at blundells school at tiverton, devon, when he assaulted the girl under the guise of giving her a sports massage. Roberts-jones, 29, was cleared of sexually assaulting two other girls at a summer ball and a camping trip by a jury in february at exeter crown court. He was a physics teacher at the â£31,000 a year school but now lives in france. The court heard details of the conviction are to be supplied to the french authorities to ensure roberts-jones, previously of preston street, exeter, is not able to work with children again. In may 2014, he offered to give his victim a massage after she suffered cramp but went on to lift her top and try to pull down her trousers. Recorder mr philip mott, qc said there was a "higher culpability because of the abuse of trust". He said: "this was not just flirting and an error of judgment but a more determined effort to pursue your desire and overcome her resistance." The judge said roberts-jones, who now teaches adults in france, had experienced "substantial punishment in terms of career, self image and place in society" and suspended his sentence for two years. He ordered roberts-jones to pay â£2,500 costs and sign on the sex offenders register. Emily cook, for the defence, said there was an "element of infatuation" with the victim which "got out of hand".
