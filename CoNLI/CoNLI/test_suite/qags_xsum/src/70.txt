Cardiff city boss neil warnock has confirmed the club will start discussing a new contract for midfielder peter whittingham. On 11 january, 32-year-old whittingham will have been with the bluebirds a decade, but his latest deal in the welsh capital runs out in the summer. It looks certain whittingham will commit his future to the bluebirds by signing a new contract. "we'll talk about that before the fa cup probably," said warnock. Cardiff face fulham in the third round of the fa cup on sunday, 8 december, but before that, on monday 2 january, the bluebirds entertain whittingham's former club, aston villa in the championship. Back in 2007, then-cardiff boss dave jones, bought whittingham from villa for a fee of Â£350,000. Since then, the dead-ball specialist has established himself as one of the most popular players ever to pull on a cardiff shirt. He has been named in the championship team of the season three times and, in 2015, he was included in the football league team of the decade. Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the bluebirds. During his time with cardiff, whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the welsh club. This season he is currently the club's joint-top scorer in the league having found the net five times so far. But despite that, warnock says he will not be rushed into a new contract to keep the midfielder. "that's the least of my worries at the minute. I haven't sorted my own [contract] out yet, let alone peter's," joked warnock. "peter knows, i've said to him,'you'll be here as long as me peter' and he laughed and said, i know, that's what worries me. "no, we've got a few days [before the fulham game] then we've got no league points to worry about so we'll probably have a chat during that period."
