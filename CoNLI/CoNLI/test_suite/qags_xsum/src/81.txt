Fear of discrimination means 84,000 deaf and hard of hearing people hide their condition from prospective employers, new research has revealed. An action on hearing loss cymru survey found many job seekers are reluctant to list it on job applications. The charity spoke to one deaf person who had not had an interview in 16 years of stating they were deaf on cvs. Many public sector organisations were found to show poor practice in the report to mark deaf awareness week. Maggie hampton of fairwater, cardiff, told bbc radio wales that she found it "very disheartening." In the interview she said: "it was very very difficult. Nobody wanted to employ a deaf person. Even in the most lowly of jobs really. I never got interviews. I just never heard back. "i did follow it up with one organisation and asked'why have i not got an interview?' And the reply was'well you are deaf, you couldn't possibly manage.' "so i did cleaning for two or three years, it was the only thing i could do. "i didn't like it very much but i did it because i needed to work. "it was very hard and very disheartening. Just that feeling that nobody wants you. And that feeling that you cannot contribute anything." She  said many deaf people do not declare the fact on their cvs as they "want to fit in". Action on hearing loss cymru director richard williams said 84,000 people, or 4% of wales' working-age population, are deaf or wear hearing aids. "that's the equivalent to filling the millennium stadium with people who are all being discriminated against at work because they can't hear well," he added.
