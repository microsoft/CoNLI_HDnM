Rihanna has released a collaboration with kanye west and paul mccartney, called four five seconds. It's been almost a year since the 26-year-old released her last single. Mccartney is one of the most celebrated artists of the 20th century, selling over 100 millions albums worldwide, as part of the beatles, wings and as a solo artist in his own right. West has previously collaborated with both rihanna and mccartney, though never before as a trio. Four five seconds is a move away from rihanna and west's previous work together on all of the lights (from west's album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy) and run this town, where the pair teamed up with jay z. This time the track is a slower, acoustic guitar-driven number. West played a snippet of four five seconds to industry experts at the iheartmedia music summit on wednesday. It's yet to be confirmed if the song will appear on an album by any of the artists. Though producer ty dolla $ign did tell billboard earlier this month that the song is likely be part of west's upcoming release. It follows west's own collaboration with mccartney at the beginning of the year. When only one was released, a spokesperson for west said that the song would be the first "publicly available recording from what has become a prolific musical collaboration between these two legendary artists." The pair began working together in los angeles last year. At the time a statement noted, it began with "a simple brainstorming session between the two, with mccartney improvising on the keyboards and kanye vocally sketching and shaping ideas in a stream-of-consciousness riff." It's possible four five seconds was also a result of these sessions. 72-year-old mccartney has a long history of collaborations with other artists, singing duets with stevie wonder, michael jackson and george michael.
