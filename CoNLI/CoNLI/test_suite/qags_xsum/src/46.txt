A woman whose son saved her from being killed by an intruder paid tribute to him as his funeral took place. Kyle clarke, 27, died when he was hit by a car in hengrove, bristol in january and was dragged along under the vehicle for 600m. His mother helen stockford described him as the "light of her life". In 2009, kyle saved her from a convicted murderer and rapist who was on parole from prison. Kyle interrupted kenneth shirley who had broken into the family home, raped his mother and planned to kill her. Shirley, known by his middle name of mark, had been released from prison on licence after serving 16 years of a life sentence for the ritualistic murder of a pensioner. Mrs stockford said her son had been badly affected by the incident and developed an eating disorder. Following shirley's conviction, which saw mrs stockford waive her anonymity to campaign for longer prison terms, kyle had looked after her. She said: "over the dark seven years it's always been'you alright today mum? Is there anywhere we need to take you today mum? Do you need me to do anything? "what i miss most is, wherever he was, he would say'night night mum', and i'm still waiting and that's crippled me. "he was just so funny. There's so much you can say about him. He was the light of my life really. He was just so lovely, always joking, smiling, laughing." Shakrun islam, 30, from chipping sodbury is charged with kyle's manslaughter. He is to appear before bristol crown court on friday.
