A report has found the police control room service has "performed well" after closing its dumfries site and moving provision to glasgow and motherwell. The south of scotland facility shut last year despite a local campaign for its retention. A report to dumfries and galloway council said the new service was proving of a "high standard". However, it said changes to it systems meant "direct performance comparisons" were not possible. The dumfries site was the first of a number of control centres across scotland to be shut as part of plans to modernise the service. The union unison described it as a "sad day" for the town and more than 30 staff involved. A review of its impact has claimed that many figures could not be directly compared between the old service and the new one. It did find satisfaction levels were "consistently above 90%". The report also revealed that just nine out of the 34 staff affected now remained with police scotland. It concluded that the public and police officers in dumfries and galloway had benefited from the larger operating model and more modern it systems. Although it had been a "significant change", the report's verdict was that it had performed "to the satisfaction of the public". What do you think?
