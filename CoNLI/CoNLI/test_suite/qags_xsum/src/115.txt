Depay, who played under united manager louis van gaal during his time as netherlands boss, had attracted interest from a number of clubs across europe, with paris st-germain and liverpool reportedly keen to sign him.

"he's a wonderful exponent of our training and will make a nice transition to a magnificent club in a beautiful competition. "we obviously lose a fantastic player, which is of great value to the team. But psv grants him this wonderful step." Depay played at the 2014 world cup in brazil as the netherlands finished third before van gaal quit as head coach to take over at manchester united. He made his international debut on 15 october 2013, coming on in the last minute of the netherlands' 2-0 world cup qualifying win in turkey.
