Schoolchildren will perform their own work at this year's proms. Two special concerts at the royal albert hall will see pupils perform their own response to 10 pieces of classic music. The ten pieces project was announced last year as part of an initiative to inspire primary school children to learn more about classical music. Each prom will feature pupils playing music, as well as dance, film and animation. The schoolchildren's work will run alongside the bbc national orchestra of wales, which will play the original 10 pieces of music, which include mozart, handel and holst. Blue peter's barney harwood and children's tv presenters dick and dom will host the concerts on 18 and 19 july, the opening weekend of this year's proms. The saturday concert will be broadcast live on bbc radio 3, while the sunday concert will be recorded for future broadcast on bbc radio 2. Last june, the bbc announced ten pieces of classical music aimed at inspiring schoolchildren to create their own works. Since october 2014, some 8,500 primary school pupils have signed up to take part in the scheme, which offers musical workshops from local arts organisations as well as an online film about classical music, which has been seen by more than 120,000 children so far. The schoolchildren are being invited to submit their "creative responses" to the music to the ten pieces website, as either films, audio recordings or images, by the end of march.
