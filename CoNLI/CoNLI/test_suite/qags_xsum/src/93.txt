Great britain skeleton racer david swift has retired from the sport. The devon-based 31-year-old's last race was the world championships in february where he finished in 16th place. Having been a sprinter, swift entered the gb programme while at university in bath in 2006 and won the british title in 2008, as well as silver at the world junior championships that year. He won his first senior race in january this year when he took gold at st moritiz in the europa cup. "i have loved every minute of the last 10 years representing great britain," said swift in a statement. Media playback is not supported on this device. "however, i feel i have now achieved everything i am capable of in the sport. I'm disappointed not to have made an olympic games but i am so proud of everything i have achieved and will have absolutely no regrets moving forward. "there comes a time where real life sort of catches up with you, and i have to acknowledge that. I never came into the sport for money - i wanted to chase a dream, and i've lived that dream. "from winning a race and hearing the national anthem at the birthplace of our sport, to being a test pilot at the sochi track in the lead up to the 2014 winter olympics, there are far too many memories to mention, all of which put a huge smile on my face." Gb skeleton performance director andi schmid said: "swifty has been a fantastic servant to gb skeleton over the past 10 years. "he has had a hugely positive impact on his team-mates and coaches and the sport as a whole and we thank him for his significant contribution to the programme."
