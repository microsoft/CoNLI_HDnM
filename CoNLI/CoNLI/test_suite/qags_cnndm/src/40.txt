The queen awards a victoria cross to lance corporal joshua leakey, who showed immense bravery by drawing enemy fire and helping his comrades before taking the fight to the taliban in august 2013. It is just the sixth time the queen has given a vc to a living, british recipient during her reign. L / cpl leakey said he was `uncomfortable' about being singled out ahead of others in his regiment and insisted the battle was `just one job, one patrol out of multiple patrols' l / cpl leakey is only the sixth living british soldier the queen has presented with his medal. He was invested in a ceremony at windsor castle. L / cpl leakey, of 1 para, is the third british serviceman to receive the vc for bravery during the afghanistan campaign but the other two awards were made posthumously. In 2013, he braved heavy gunfire from 20 taliban insurgents in helmand to rush to the aid of a wounded us marine. He also took control of a machine gun post to begin the fightback, then ran down a barren hillside, dodging a hail of bullets, picked up another machine gun and continued the battle in which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. According to the official citation, l / cpl leakey, who is single and from hampshire, showed `complete disregard for his own safety' as his unit came under attack for around an hour.
