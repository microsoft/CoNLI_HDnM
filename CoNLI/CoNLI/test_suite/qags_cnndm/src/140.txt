Leeds showed they are in good shape to cope with kevin sinfield's retirement as they claimed a 26 - 12 derby victory over castleford in front of a sell - out crowd at the mend - a - hose jungle. The first utility super league leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on good friday, but they continue to thrive without him.

Ryan hall was sent to the sin - bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but castleford failed to take advantage and it was the rhinos who struck first as joel moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending leeds' lead and stevie ward's converted try cancelled out michael shenton's effort to give the rhinos a 16 - 6 half - time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when hall completed his double. Adam cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite shenton's late second, leeds extended their unbeaten run against the tigers to six matches.
