This felt a heavy blow for derby county. Looking on course for a first victory in seven championship games against the 10 men of watford, they conceded an equaliser to odion ighalo that further undermines their promotion ambitions. Adlene guedioura seized on hesitant defending by craig forsyth with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his watford team - mate, who poked the ball past lee grant to snatch an unlikely point. There was a seismic rally from the hosts, who ended the game camped in watford's box, never mind half. The final act was heurelho gomes producing a fingertip save from richard keogh's header.
