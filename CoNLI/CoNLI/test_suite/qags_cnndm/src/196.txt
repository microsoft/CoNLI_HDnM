The jockey they all struggle to beat but also a rider no sane jockey would attempt to emulate. That is the verdict of colleague andrew thornton when trying to explain what has made ap mccoy such a dominant force in his sport. Cheltenham gold cup winner thornton has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness mccoy's entire career, from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar. Ap mccoy will race at sandown on saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career. Mccoy has two rides at sandown on saturday before he retires from professional racing for good. ` it is a bit like watching lionel messi on a horse,' said thornton. ` he had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. ` it might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20 - time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But ap loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. ` he judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for jonjo o' neill. ` when he was with martin pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. ` he is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's grand national, and when he won it in 2010 on don't push it, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. ` you also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' Mccoy ( left -
