Arsene wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his arsenal team. Wenger lifts the fa cup following arsenal's triumph over hull city at wembley last season. ` you try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. ` when two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference.' I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then i make my decision.' But even though the frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after arsenal's fa cup win last season. Wenger said : `anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line - up will be. ` you live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day. ` if you don't know on friday night, you will not know on saturday morning
