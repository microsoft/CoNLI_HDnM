As an individual, a family and a community, we are helping the police to solve this heinous crime.' Murhaf continued : `he was the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet. He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. ` he did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. ` he was an old fashioned man who thought love and understanding could cure all of the world's ills. He was always smiling and joking with everyone he met. ` he showed so much love to his congregation and to his community as an imam and a loving father to us
