Kevin gameiro saved his goalkeeper's blushes with a late equaliser which put defending champions sevilla into the last four of the europa league. Beto had looked to have cost his side their progress, with the game heading towards extra time, before substitute gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining. It had been a risk to start the portuguese keeper, but sevilla boss unai emery decided it one he was prepared to take, despite beto's absence since a game against real madrid in the first week of february. Carlos bacca slams home the early penalty after vitolo had been brought down by neto after five minute. Hulk celebrates his goal with axel witsel but zenit couldn't hold on for extra time in the end. It was a gamble that spectacularly back - fired, with the keeper gifting zenit two of the softest goals imaginable, to see the holders surrender a two - goal lead in the tie. First, just a matter of seconds after the half - time break, with sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising, beto dropped the ball, under no pressure, at the feet of salomon rondon, allowing the venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards. Then, when brazilian forward hulk hit a speculative, but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards, beto could only flap it over his own line, turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time. But as zenit looked to apply the pressure, and beto attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves, one from each of the two goalscorers, the champions struck on the break. Bacca is mobbed by his sevilla team - mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on. Zenit : lodygin, criscito, neto, lombaerts, smolnikov ; garcia, witsel ; danny, shatov, hulk, rondon - lrb
