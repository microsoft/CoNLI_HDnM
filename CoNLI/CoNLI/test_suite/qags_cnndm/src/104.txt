Few people can fail be wowed by technicolor butterfly wings that `sparkle' in the sunlight. And now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity, including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings. Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video. These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth. The photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry. The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail. The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north america and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern us, where it is common in many different habitats.
