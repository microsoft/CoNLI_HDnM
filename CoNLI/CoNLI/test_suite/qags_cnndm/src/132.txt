Jimmy's ton up. Jimmy anderson was given a silver cap by mike atherton to mark his 100th test. And well deserved it was, too. The list of fast bowling centurions is a short one and anderson finds himself in good company with courtney walsh ( 132 ), glenn mcgrath ( 124 ), chaminda vaas ( 111 ), shaun pollock ( 108 ), wasim akram ( 104 ) and makhaya ntini ( 101 ). Jimmy anderson was presented with a special silver cap after reaching 100 test matches for england. Richie remembered. In a week when cricket lost one of its most revered voices, respectful tributes were paid before play began in antigua. Both teams stood either side of the pitch for a minute's silence in honour of the late, great richie benaud, who passed away last week. The players and officials also wore black armbands to show their respect. Both teams paid their respects to richie benaud before the start of play after he died last week. Candid cameron. Dave cameron - - the west indies cricket board president as opposed to the prime minister - - said he needed to convince his team of the worth of playing for their country rather than playing for themselves. He told the bbc : `we have to help them understand that the team is the most important thing.' High and knighty. There were some famous faces on show as the two ends of the sir vivian richards stadium were renamed in honour of sir curtly ambrose and sir andy roberts. Both were knighted at the ground in 2014 and sir curtly was joined by sir viv before play started. Though the power seems to have gone to curtly's head, judging by his unusual haircut. . .
