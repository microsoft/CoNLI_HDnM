The number of hayfever sufferers in the uk is predicted to reach 20 million this summer, up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country. For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told mailonline. And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31. 8 million sufferers. Dr jean emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, `depending on weather conditions'. She said : `if we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. ` grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk. ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added : `in addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from april to the end of august
