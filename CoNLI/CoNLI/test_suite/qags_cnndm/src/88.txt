Bali nine member myuran sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self - portrait, showing a bullet through his heart. The painting is a self - portrait of sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart. It comes after it was confirmed that australians andrew chan and sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on wednesday ( 3am aest ). The date - april 29 - became official when a local funeral director in cilacap, the nearest port to nusakambangan, or death island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well - known australian artist ben quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives.
