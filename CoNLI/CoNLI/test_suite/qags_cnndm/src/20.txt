That's pretty much the chosen shot,'' said belue, who enjoys it herself now and then. ` `on an average night, we probably go through three or four bottles.' ' if you're young - - say, under 35 - - this may not be news to you. Fireball, which didn't exist in its current form a decade ago, is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in america.
