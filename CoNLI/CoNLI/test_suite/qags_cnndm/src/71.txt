Arsene wenger wants cesc fabregas to be shown the `respect he deserves' when he returns to the emirates stadium in the blue of chelsea on sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of arsenal's supporters feel he doesn't deserve much. That became obvious on thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a fabregas banner from the ken friar bridge. Cesc fabregas returns to arsenal on sunday and arsene wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception. Wenger wants `respect' for the club's former players and counts fabregas as a man who deserves that. Gunners fans offer their good luck to fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time. Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from barcelona to chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re - sign the player, saying : `we will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.' When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added : `it's not as clean as that. I can not speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on sunday.' At that point it was suggested to wenger that fabregas chose not to come back and wenger said : `i don't know, i don't know.' The frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew fabregas was available, a deal with chelsea was virtually concluded - - comments which jarred a little with the spaniard's statement last summer that arsenal `decided not to take' their option.
