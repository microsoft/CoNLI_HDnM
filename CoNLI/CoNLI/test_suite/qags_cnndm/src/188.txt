The birth of alanna and stephan goetzinger's third daughter was meant to go like the previous two - an intimate family moment that took place in a wading pool their bedroom at home, lit by candles. Instead, the night turned to tragedy when the little girl rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards. A coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was `grossly inadequate' and may have contributed to the death of the baby. But in a move many people would find extraordinary, the couple refuses to blame the midwife, and are in fact is defending her actions. Alanna and stephen goetzinger ( pictured with their daughters kayla, right, and alice, left ) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner's report which blames their midwife. Coroner james mcdougall said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the rana's birth, allowed the delivery to take place in `unsafe conditions', and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the goeztinger's baby. Coroner mcdougall found that rana had died either `during or shortly after birth' from meconium aspiration, a condition where a foetus inhales their faeces before birth, preventing them from breathing. The report also found that the midwife, who handed in her resignation following the inquest, changed her statement about the events of the evening, including the time of the baby's birth and whether the baby had exhibited signs of life. Three years on, the couple, who live on a farm in kanungra in south - east queensland, have spoken about the night rana was born, and what they claim was a tragic and unavoidable event. Alanna, 39, and stephan, 57, are adamant that rana was stillborn, and that it was very clear
