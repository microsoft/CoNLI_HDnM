If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don't blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children's motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by goldsmiths university in london and ohio state university. More than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research ( stock image shown ). Psychologists from goldsmiths university of london, and ohio state university in the us studied more than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the uk, canada, japan, germany, russia and the us. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins' shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non - shared - environment factors had the largest effect on the children's motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact.

A review of 308 studies involving more than 1. 1 million children has now completely overturned this long - held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the university of new brunswick in canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic
