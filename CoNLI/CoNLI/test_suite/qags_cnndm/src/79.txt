Bayern munich coach pep guardiola says his team's injury situation is `critical, very critical' ahead of the bundesliga match against eintracht frankfurt and the champions league quarter final game against fc porto. Guardiola spoke after defender mehdi benatia was ruled out for up to four weeks with a hamstring injury. Wingers arjen robben and franck ribery and midfielders bastian schweinsteiger, david alaba and javi martinez are also sidelined. Bayern boss pep guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and european glory. Bayern munich defender medhi benatia ( right ) suffered a muscle injury against bayer leverkusen. Guardiola had only 14 healthy players at friday's practice. The spaniard said he was not sure `how long we can live with this situation,' adding that `we are tired.' Bayern need four more wins to secure the bundesliga title. Guardiola's team visits porto on wednesday. The former barcelona manager has suggested that his team is shackled by the absence of ribery and robben. ` without arjen robben and franck ribery, we are a different team,' guardiola said after the german cup semi - final. Ribery ( left ) is absent with an ankle injury while robben is out until may with a stomach muscle tear. ` of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one - on - one situations. We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of march. Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of munich's champions league quarter - final tie against porto.
