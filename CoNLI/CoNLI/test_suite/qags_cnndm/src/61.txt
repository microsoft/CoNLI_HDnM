An adorable orphaned wombat has found herself a new friend - and a very prickly pillow. Chloe the wombat, who first made headlines after her special bond with her surrogate zookeeper mum emerged last december, has found herself a new buddy at taronga zoo's grounds in sydney after she moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas. In an adorable video uploaded to instagram by taronga zoo, chloe is seen trying to take a nap in the mud on one of the echidnas. As she rolled over to snuggle up, the echidna moved away but chloe still rested her eyes for a moment before getting up. Scroll down for video. Chloe the wombat has mistaken her new echidna friend for a pillow at taronga zoo. She recently moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas who don't seem as eager to snuggle as she is. ` chloe wasted no time making friends with her spiky new housemates and they've been busy digging in the soft dirt together,' taronga zoo said. When she's not napping, chloe likes to follows her zoo keeper evelyn weston around the zoo. ` it's a natural behaviour and something chloe would be doing with her real mother if she'd survived,' evelyn said. Adorable wombat chloe is now one - year - old and lives at taronga zoo in sydney. She has become zoo keeper evelyn weston's little helper and follows her around the zoo. ` wombats stay with their mothers for up to two years, walking by their side until they're old enough to fend for themselves.' The pair have been inseparable since chloe came to the zoo three months ago after her mother was struck and killed by a car near jenolan caves, west of the blue mountains, in june 2014.
