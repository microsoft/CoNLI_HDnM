( cnn ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of isis, the self - anointed islamic state, or boko haram, the nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to isis. This new wave of violent islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a `` caliphate,'' a sharia - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of islam. Yazidi girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by human rights watch found `` a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by isis forces,'' actions that the group says `` are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.' ' in nigeria, boko haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2, 000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to amnesty
