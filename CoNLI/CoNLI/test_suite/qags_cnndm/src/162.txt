Norfolk, virginia ( cnn ) the second mate of the houston express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1, 000 - foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked.

Thomas grenz told cnn by phone friday. That man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35 - foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. ` `it took so long,'' jordan said. ` `it moved so slowly.' ' the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. His father, frank jordan, told cnn's jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. ` `he looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be,'' he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing. The
