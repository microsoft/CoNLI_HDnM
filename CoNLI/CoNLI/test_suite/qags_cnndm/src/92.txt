David cameron, wearing notably clean new work boots, today set out seven key tory policies which he said would help get people on to the property ladder. A million people will be able to realise the dream of home ownership by 2020, david cameron claimed today as he donned hi - vis to tour a building site. The prime minister said seven key tory policies would help get people on to the property ladder by building more homes and cutting the cost of saving for a deposit, moving house and paying off mortgages. The tory leader, wearing notably clean new work boots, as he chatted to house builders, insisted `dream of home ownership is alive'. Mr cameron used the launch of the conservative party manifesto yesterday to promise voters `security at every stage of your life'. He said the `greatest sunshine that there can possibly be' included helping more people but their own home, as well as getting a job and having dignity in retirement. Today the tory leader set out a seven point plan which he claims will help build more houses and making it easier for first - time buyers, claiming it will help a million people become homeowners over the next parliament. Mr cameron said : `the conservative party is the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your lives. ` at the heart of that is helping people onto the housing ladder. It comes back to our values. We believe if you work hard, save up, and do the right thing, you should be able to buy your own place. ` the plans in our manifesto will open home ownership to a million more people. With us, the dream of home ownership is alive. ` and it's why we can look the working people of britain in the eye and say we are with you. That's why we are setting out a seven point plan to help build more houses, and help more people get a home of their own.'
