( cnn ) north korea is in the headlines again. According to a wall street journal report thursday, chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story. The key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities.

' however, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u. S. And other experts. The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the u. S. And members of the six - party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious. Why? For a start, it would mean that north korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in north korea's mines. In addition, while the plutonium program at yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile, the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium - based program have no detect
