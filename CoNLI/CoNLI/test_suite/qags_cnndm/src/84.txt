Can rickie lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan rodgers has killed off lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining liverpool - - why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker - - playing regularly in the premier league and scoring goals for southampton. He'd just been to a world cup. Rickie lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems. Brendan rodgers' decision to ignore lambert, in favour of mario balotelli, is completely illogical. This time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since. For rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware lambert isn't luis suarez, i know he's not a world - class striker. Lambert missed out on saturday at west brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see mario balotelli get yet another chance. The england striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of premier league minutes on the pitch lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six - and - a - half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the premier league or champions league, lambert and liverpool have impressed. On his first premier league start for liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as liverpool's worst - ever
