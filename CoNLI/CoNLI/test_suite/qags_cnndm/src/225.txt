All viewed by pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ` i'd never take my cap off during a game they'd have to put it in my contract,' he explained. ` i watched the first game for albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because i'd had enough of sitting there. That's just the way i am. I want to be close to the action.' West brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit
