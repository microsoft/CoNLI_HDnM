Tens of millions of people in china marked the annual `tomb sweeping festival' this weekend by travelling home to their ancestral villages. Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the qingming festival - - which means `pure brightness' - - china celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says people's daily online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the `yellow emperor' huangdi in huangling county, shaanxi province.
