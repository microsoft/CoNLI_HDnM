The days of soft old arsenal not liking it up' em when they get north of watford are long gone. A first - half strike by the outstanding aaron ramsey was enough to see off burnley at an intimidating turf moor and record an eighth win in a row by arsene wenger's side, the best run since the invincibles team managed it in 2004. Arsenal have won at sunderland, newcastle, manchester city and now burnley, and picked up points at liverpool and everton, besides beating manchester united in the fa cup at old trafford. The only exception was a 3 - 2 defeat at stoke and even then they nearly clawed back a 3 - 0 deficit.
