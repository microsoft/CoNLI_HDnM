Police have now released cctv video footage showing the pair dragging the cases along a pavement. Simon was found guilty of murder at birmingham crown court today and bird, while being acquitted of the same charge, was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years. At a sentencing hearing, mrs justice thirlwall told simon : `you had no thought for him at all. Your focus, as so often in your life, was on what was best for you.' Simon initially denied knowledge of mr spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight after police found tiny blood droplets on the flat's lounge wall. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the rear garden following mr spalding's disappearance - a heat so intense it melted upvc guttering fascias - and forensic examination of debris from an oil drum showed it to be part of the victim's humerus bone. Michelle bird ( pictured ) was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years. Police divers recovered the second case - containing the victim's head, limbs and tools - below pope bridge, smethwick
