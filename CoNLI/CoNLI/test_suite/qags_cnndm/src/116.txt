How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans `bullied' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west europe and west asia around 40, 000 years ago. They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe. But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts. ` we're not so special, i don't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said dr seiji kadowaki, first author of the study from nagoya university, japan.

Neanderthals ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe, claims the study. The early ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west asia to europe, where neanderthals were living. Early modern humans expanded the geographic area they inhabited out of africa during a period of time
