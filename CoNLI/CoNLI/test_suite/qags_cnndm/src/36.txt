Married paul shorter ( left ), who was a teacher at convicted sex offender max clifford's ( right ) former school in hersham, surrey, is facing jail after admitting a string of sex offences. The father - of - one, of addlestone, surrey, looked shaken and spoke softly as he admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. The judge was told that the girl had not wanted a sexual relationship with shorter and on one occasion had stormed out of a personal tuition session when he tried to grope her. But that one the instances in question, which took place between december 13, 2013 and january 19 last year, there was `ostensible consent.' Shorter's pregnant wife joanne, who is expecting his child in six weeks, and other members of his family watched from the public gallery as the charges against him were read out. But judge noel lucas ruled that shorter could not be sentenced until a victim impact statement had been taken from the girl to find out how his crimes had affected her. The pair met because shorter was her maths teacher at the school, which counts convicted sex offender max clifford.
