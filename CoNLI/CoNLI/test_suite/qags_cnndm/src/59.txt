After four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun, the messenger spacecraft will this week make a death - dive into mercury. But the probe hasn't finished its mission yet, with new, detailed views emerging of the planet as messenger spirals closer to its surface. Now nasa has released an image taken by the probe's visual and infrared spectrometer ( virs ) revealing distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters.

To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the mercury dual imaging system ( mdis ). To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the mercury dual imaging system ( mdis ). This is an instrument with wide - and narrow - angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on mercury's surface. The spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet's surface at 2. 4 miles per second ( 3. 9 km / s ). The event will take place on thursday 30 april at 3 : 30 pm eastern time ( 7. 30 pm gmt ). However, when it does, messenger will be behind mercury, and hidden from earth. ` the last couple of hours will probably be pretty quiet,' mercury mission head sean solomon told nature. ` there will be a final orbit when the spacecraft passes behind the planet and we won't hear from it again.' I have worked on the mission for 19 years. It's like losing a member of the family. Even pre - knowledge doesn't prepare you completely for the loss.' The mercury dual imaging system
