The head of the immgration department declared monday a public holiday for 8, 500 staff, but other departments such as the australian taxation office and defence will have to turn up to work.

Em ployees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, australians have an entitlement mentality,' said mr dundon, the boss of direct health solutions. ` they're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent - 25 per cent rise in absenteeism on monday 27.
