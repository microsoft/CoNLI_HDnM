Raheem sterling could force his way out of liverpool this summer, costing the club up to $ 25million while saving potential suitors such as manchester city and chelsea the same amount. Under premier league regulations the 20 - year - old is entitled to `buy - out' the last year of his current contract which runs out in 2017. The effect of that would see the fee liverpool could command for the forward dramatically reduce. Raheem sterling has rejected a new $ 100, 000 - a - week contract with liverpool and could leave this summer. The 20 year - old could lower his value by buying - out the last year of his current deal for $ 1. 7 million. Liverpool insist they will hold firm and not be forced into selling sterling in the close season. However, the reds would have to reconsider their stance if sterling and his advisers go down the route of buying out a chunk of his contract. It is understood liverpool value sterling as high as $ 50million given his age, talent and potential. However, if sterling effectively only had one year left on his contract that fee would be reduced considerably - perhaps even in half to $ 25 million. With sterling currently on a $ 35, 000 a week, it would cost the england international $ 1. 7 m to buy out the last year of his contract. That sum could swiftly be recouped in the form of a signing on fee with a new club and, of course, in wages. Manchester city and chelsea are both keen on sterling, pictured racing against philippe coutinho. Sterling's value could plummet by up to $ 25million is he chooses to buy - out the final year of his contract. Liverpool have remained steadfast that their current offer of $ 100, 000 - a - week, with potential increments, is more than fair. But the player and his advisers believe he is now worthy of earning in the region of $ 150, 000 - a - week
