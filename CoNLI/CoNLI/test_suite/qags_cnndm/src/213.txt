Tony pulis returned to selhurst park for the first time since he left crystal palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his west bromwich albion side to the edge of safety. Alan pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit pulis but an early goal from james morrison and stunner from craig gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between palace's fans and pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10 - month tenure, when he won the premier league lma manager of the year award. West brom midfielder craig gardner celebrates having scored the second for tony pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort. Before two minutes on the clock, james morrison ( right ) headed west brom ahead following a corner from team - mate chris brunt. The west brom players race to congratulate morrison ( top left ), who headed the away side in front against crystal palace on saturday.
