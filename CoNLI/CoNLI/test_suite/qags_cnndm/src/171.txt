Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the amazon. They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of yanomami people living in a remote amazon village in venezuela who had not had previous contact with non - yanomami. There are about 26, 000 yanomami living in brazil and 15, 000 in venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the amazonian region of south america. There are about 26, 000 yanomami living in brazil and 15, 000 in venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The yanomami are hunter - gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. ` that tells us that western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at university of san diego said. ` studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co - author rob knight. In the new study published april 17 by science advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of yanomami people living in a remote amazon village in venezuela who had not had previous contact with non - yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co - exist with people who have never been
