With a `megadrought' forecast to hit the us in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the rockies and seeding the sky with silver iodide. They hope the technology will allow them to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change - - but not everyone is convinced. With a `megadrought' forecast to hit the us in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the rockies, and seeding the sky with silver iodide. The process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the general electric labs in schenectady, new york. Two decades later, the central arizona project and the salt river project invested in research to make it a reality. ` it hasn't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future,' nancy selover, arizona's state climatologist told becky brisley at cronkite news. Since 2007, cap has put about $ 1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the colorado river system. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice. If it seems like it never stops raining, blame the russians. Or even the north koreans. Cia chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world's weather, a conference heard in february. A leading academic told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. Professor alan robock, from rutgers university in new jersey, said : `consultants working for the cia rang and said we'
