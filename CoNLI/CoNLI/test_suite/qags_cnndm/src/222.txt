Vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition, but do we really need pills to optimise our diet?

She continued.' A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said.
